# Microservice Dependency Graph

Microservice architecture enables scalable and extensible systems by breaking down functionality into small, independent components. However, as these systems evolve, ensuring compliance with policies and design constraints becomes challenging. To address this, a technique for constructing a Microservices Dependency Graph (MDG). This graph models call and data dependencies between microservices, service buses, publish-subscribe frameworks, and databases.

The MDG is built using log analysis and probabilistic reasoning to associate logged events. It is a labeled, typed, directed multigraph where:

* Nodes represent microservices, service buses, and databases.

* Edges represent data exchanges and request interactions.

Currently the framework is only configured to work the "Pitstop - Garage Mangagement System" (https://github.com/EdwinVW/pitstop)application. Additional work needs to be done to handle different microservice and database logging standards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or higher
* Docker
* Required Python Libraries (install via requirements.txt)


### Steps
1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Andres-Osamu/Microservice_Dependency_Graph.git
cd microservice_Dependency_Graph
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Ensure Docker is running on your system
* [Currently the framework is only configured to work with Pitstop](https://github.com/EdwinVW/pitstop)

### Usage
